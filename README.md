# vim-tmux-setup

This repo consist of all my dot files and kie to be able to recreate my OS X Terminal (256 color), tmux & vim setup going again.

* It includes my .vim folder for which I used "Vundle" as my vim plugin manager.
* It also requires that you import the "Solarized Dark/Light" Terminal Theme which can be found here on my machine: /Users/righardt.swanepoel/.vim/bundle/solarized/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized/Solarized\ Dark\ ansi.terminal
* Set the above terminal colour in the "Advanced" tab to 256 to be able to have the airline themes display colour the way it is meant to be.
